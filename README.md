# 🚢 Task 2: Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Objective
To analyze the Titanic dataset and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster based on personal and travel information.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)  
2. **Feature Engineering** – converted categorical variables (Sex, Embarked, Pclass) into numeric  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – studied survival patterns across gender, age, class, etc.  
 

## 📈 Visualizations
- Survival rate by **Gender** (bar chart)  
- Survival rate by **Passenger Class (Pclass)**  
- Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors  
- Heatmap for feature correlations  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

## 🚀 Outcome
- Found that **women and children had higher survival rates**  
- **Passenger class and age** played a significant role in survival probability  
- Achieved a reliable model for survival prediction
